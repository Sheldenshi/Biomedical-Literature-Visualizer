in certain area; -social and hygienic conditions (life style and level): trench fever (Bartonella quintana) in battlefields, refugee camps (Rwanda) or in homeless people (southern France, Seattle and Moscow); -close contact between humans and domestic animals: \"mixing\" areas in southeast Asia for avian, swine and human influenza A viruses; -a collective style of life: communal eating habits (company canteens, fast-food places: hamburgers contaminated with E. coli O157, or chicken meat with Campylobacter jejuni) and accommodation patterns;Socio-Economic Factors-the degree of countryside urbanisation (expansion of towns, especially in tropical regions); formation of \"slums\" with good conditions for epidemic outbreaks (e.g. malaria, yellow fever, dengue, Chagas disease, plague etc.); -\"suburbanization\", i.e. building of detached houses in peri-urban forested arease.g. in Connecticut (USA: annual incidence of Lyme borreliosis here up to 1,000 per 100,000 population, while in Central Europe only about 30-50 per 100,000); or in forested districts of Novosibirsk (presenting a very high morbidity with RSSE); -the colonisation of new lands (\"pioneers\") and the following anthropogenic impact in ecosystems involving building of settlements, extensive landscaping (yellow fever during building of Panama Canal, Oroya fever during railway construction in Venezuela, RSSE at construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway), deforestation (scrub typhus, Nipah fever associated with the movement of reservoir fruit bats to farmland after the cutting down of trees, malaria in Brazil), but also reforestation (LB in eastern USA); -the construction of water reservoirs, irrigation of farmland (schistosomiasis in Asuan, mosquito-borne diseases) and draining marshes; -unintentional creation of new, artificial breeding places for mosquito larvae such as water-containing and for insects accessible pots, barrels, tanks, used tyres, sewage systems, etc.; -rapid international transport and commerce: importation of new pathogenic agents, invertebrate vectors and vertebrate reservoirs (e.g. \"airport malaria\"; import of used tyres or decorative plants like lucky bamboo (Dracaena) \u2192 dispersal of Asian mosquitoes Aedes albopictus and Ae. japonicus to America, Africa and parts of Europe; yellow fever spread from Africa to America with the slave trade together with the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti on ships); -the markedly increased mobility and migrability of the human population for business (each year >500 million dealers and merchants fly to foreign destinations), tourism and education, the immigration of workers from abroad; -expanded domestic tourism connected with potential entering natural foci of infectious diseases (TBE, LB, etc.); tourism to foreign countries, foreign trade fairs and pilgrimage with potential risk of acquiring an \"exotic\" or other infectious zoonotic or sapronotic disease (Lassa, Ebola); \"adrenaline tourism\" (leptospirosis in water sports); -leisure time activities (hunting at home and abroad, safaris, and the collection of mushrooms and forest berries), leading to an enhanced contact with vectors of diseases; -an increased density of pets and companion animals in the human population; -the expansion and intensification (concentration, specialisation) of agriculture (e.g. this led to enhanced incidence of leishmaniasis in the Caucasus and Nepal due to overpopulation of burrowing rodents; Apodemus agrarius prefers rice fields in eastern Asia \u2192 increased incidence of HFRS; new irrigated rice paddies in south Asia \u2192 Japanese encephalitis; integrated duck and swine farms in China \u2192 risk of origin of influenza pandemic strains);Socio-Economic Factors-the processing and consumption of animal products and animal waste: for instance, BSE in Great Britain originated from the consumption by cows of meatbone meal from sheep with scrapie, and led to the follow-up outbreak of a new variant of CJD in humans; -the movements of herds and flocks of domestic ruminants to new pastures, and nomadism; -the import and export of domestic animals, their products and foods of animal origin (eggs -salmonellosis); -the domestication of animals (mainly in the past), deer farming in many parts of the world (at present): risk of brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis or paratuberculosis; -the import and breeding of exotic animals in zoos, safari parks, for research or private use; -the occupational risk of zoonotic and sapronotic diseases especially for: animal breeders and keepers, vets, butchers and slaughterhouse workers; forest workers (ixodid tick-borne diseases); casual labourers (pulmonary mycotic infections); medical laboratory workers and researchers; -nosocomial/iatrogenic zoonotic infections (viruses Ebola, Lassa, CCHF) at blood transfusions (HIV, malaria, CTF, babesiosis etc.) and organ transplantations; -xenotransplantation (contaminated organs of animals that are transplanted to humans), animal cell cultures used for preparation of vaccines: for instance, in pigs hepatitis E and retrovirus infections occur asymptomatically; -drug abuse (HIV, hepatitis, anthrax); -cosmetic operations (piercing, tattooing); -insufficiency or absence of health prevention (including health education) and care, decline of health system infrastructure; -social disasters and stress (wars, refugee camps, famine).Socio-Economic FactorsWe can say with certain degree of exaggeration that a common denominator in nearly all socio-economic factors in zoonoses and sapronoses is the globalisation of: economics, the transport of goods, animals, and persons, tourism and recreation, animal and plant production, life style,
