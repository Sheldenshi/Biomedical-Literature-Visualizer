frequently) \u2022 increased risk to the team delivering ECT, due to the higher risk of infection from patients receiving general anaesthesia and potential aerosolisation of patients' respiratory material Applying these principles to clinical scenarios Applying Emanuel et al's principles and the ECT-specific considerations outlined above, a high-priority patient might be a young healthcare
