respiratory signs have little significance in evaluating immunity in challenge-exposed birds, as observations of these signs were sporadic in the controls.DiscussionThe use of inactivated AIB virus vaccines have a greater potential today than ever before, as we continually learn of latent virus infections of the respiratory tract of supposedly recovered chickens (12) .", [["trachea", "ANATOMY",
