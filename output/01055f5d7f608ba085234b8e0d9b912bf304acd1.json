and the North American consensus guideline on allergy care during COVID.(8,9,28,29) It is recommended that children not \u2018step down\u2019 any controller medication during this time unless \u2018this is clearly favorable from an individual standpoint, with careful consideration of the balance between benefit and harm/burden.\u2019(8) Other recommendations to maintain asthma control include avoiding known asthma triggers such as aeroallergens, frequent handwashing, physical distancing, and regular review of inhaler technique.(9,29) An exacerbation, if it occurred, \u2018could require [children] to enter the healthcare system, which would put them at increased risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic.\u2019(8)Treatment of Asthma During COVID-19Some biologic agents, such as omalizumab (anti-IgE) and mepolizumab (anti-IL5), are approved for use in moderate to severe asthma in adolescents(30) The current recommendation for adolescents who are using these medications is to continue their use.(8) There is no current evidence that use of these medications increases the risk of COVID-19 infection or morbidity.Treatment of Asthma During COVID-19If a child is using a nebulized asthma relief medication, this should be switched to a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or dry powder inhaler (turbuhaler or diskus) under most circumstances.(8,9) Nebulization increases the risk of viral lower lung deposition.(8,9,31) It also increases the risk of infection transmission due to both stimulating a cough reflex, as well as generating \u2018a high volume of respiratory aerosols that may be propelled over a longer distance than is involved in a natural dispersion pattern.\u2019(31) It was poignantly noted in a recent editorial that \u2018there is a possibility that nebulizer therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection can transmit potentially viable coronavirus to susceptible bystander hosts.\u2019(31) The only possible reasons for a child to use a nebulizer at home during the COVID-19 pandemic are a poor response to a MDI/spacer, a child who is either uncooperative or unable to follow the directions required for MDI use, or medication shortages (which are discussed in more detail below).(8,9,31)Treatment of Asthma Exacerbations during COVID-19The CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) have recommended against oral corticosteroid (OCS) use as a treatment for COVID-19.(32,33) This recommendation is based on experience with influenza, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), where OCS use prolonged viral replication and was associated with prolonged viral clearance, increased complication rates, increased risk of mechanical ventilation and higher mortality rates.(34, 35, 36, 37) It has been noted that OCS therapy increases the risk of nosocomial infection and secondary infection.(38) However, there is a distinction between OCS use as a therapy for COVID-19, and OCS use as a treatment of asthma exacerbations.(8) There is broad consensus that asthma exacerbations should be treated aggressively and in keeping with current guideline recommendations.(9) Multiple national and international organizations such as the Global Initiative for Asthma recommend OCS use as required, and in keeping with the child\u2019s asthma action plan, during COVID-19.(8,9,28)Treatment of Asthma Exacerbations
