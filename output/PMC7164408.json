underwent chemotherapy or surgery within one month of infection, twelve on follow-up post tumour resection and two not known), noting that these patients were more likely to experience severe sequelae of COVID-19 infection (defined as intensive care admission, invasive ventilation or death).2MainOf course, the myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy and of metastatic malignancy are well understood, and it is reasonable to hypothesise that these patients will be more susceptible to severe infection and complications.3 Liang et al. estimate that the risk of developing severe events is significantly higher in patients with cancer, with a hazard ratio of 3.56, but we must be mindful that this is based on a small patient number (n = 18) and a heterogeneous population.2 Furthermore, some chemotherapy agents and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) can themselves contribute to or cause pneumonitis.4,5 Thus, managing COVID-19 in these patients could be challenging and requires a
