perplexing absence of MERS-CoV cases in Africa, despite the presence of the virus in camels, presumably because of the frequent presence of protective polymorphisms of DPP4 in Africans.102 In one in vitro study, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, and saxagliptin could not block the entry of coronaviruses into cells.103 Although ACE2 is the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, a recent modeling study did not rule out its interaction with CD26 or DPP4.103 At present, there is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of DPP4 inhibitors in patients with DM and COVID-19.104ACE2 and potential therapeutic implications ::: THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH OBESITY AND OBESITY-RELATED DISORDERSThe physiological role of ACE2 counter-regulates the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013 aldosterone system (RAAS).105 Independent of the RAAS, ACE2 also regulates intestinal amino acid homeostasis and the gut microbiome.106 In COIVD-19, ACE2 on the respiratory epithelium serve as a main entry of SARS-CoV-2.107 Interaction of SARS-CoV with ACE2 is initiated via trimers of the SARS spike protein, which extends into a hydrophobic pocket of the ACE2 catalytic domain that is independent of its peptidase activity.108 ACE2 is highly expressed in the lung as well as in the heart, endothelium, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, and the tissue distribution of ACE2 overlaps with the
