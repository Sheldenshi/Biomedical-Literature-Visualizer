virus has reemerged since November 2013, resulting in the second outbreak in China.2 This novel influenza virus can bind to both avian (alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid) and human (alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid) receptors.3 It also contains human-adapted amino acid markers.4,5 These adaptations may explain why the virus can cause outbreaks in the human population.6 Patients infected with the H7N9 virus typically show symptoms such as fever, cough, opacities, and consolidation on chest radiography, and some severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure.4 Although the lethality of H7N9 influenza is comparatively lower than that of highly pathogenic H5N1 viral infection, it is much higher than that of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza, reaching approximately 30%.7 Furthermore, high-pathogenicity markers for human-adapted influenza virus, such as an E637K amino acid substitution in the PB2 gene and Q226L in the haemagglutinin (HA) gene, have
