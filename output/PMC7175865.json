practicability, and data analysis, with a particular focus on wastewater temperature as an underappreciated source of data bias in WBE when performing population-wide screening for SARS-CoV-2.Estimation of initial SARS-CoV-2 loads in wastewater ::: MethodologyThe SARS-CoV-2 load to municipal wastewater was estimated using excretion rates in human stool recently reported by Zhang et al. (2020e) and W\u00f6lfel et al. (2020), and assuming a fecal load in the range of 100\u2013400 g feces/day/person, and a fecal density of 1.06 g/mL (Brown et al., 1996).Estimation of COVID-19 persistence in wastewater ::: MethodologyThe degradation over time of a biomarker of interest present in wastewater can be expected to follow exponential decay, described by the formula as:(1)Nt=N012tt12where N(t) is the quantity that still remains and has not yet decayed after a time (i.e., the amount measured by the sampling campaign); N0 is the initial quantity of the substance that was excreted and discharged into the wastewater collection system; t1/2 is the half-life of the biomarker, and t is the time elapsed between the time of excretion (time = 0) and time of observation/sample collection (time = t).Estimation of COVID-19 persistence in wastewater ::: MethodologyThe adjusted biomarker half-lives were based on the calculated wastewater temperature, a series of initial biomarker half-lives reported at ambient
