experimental protocols and observed surface disinfection efficacies are highly variable between studies, including the use of different preparation methods for the test organisms (e.g. washing bacteria); inoculation methods (e.g. liquid vs. dry aerosols for spores); surface carrier size (from <1 to 100 cm 2 ); drying times (from no drying to 24 hours) and conditions (temperature, relative humidity); disinfectant application mode (e.g. immersion, spraying, or wiping), concentration and exposures time; soil loads; neutralization procedures and media; and, recovery methods post-disinfection (e.g. vortexing, sonicating, swabbing, scraping were described).DiscussionIn this systematic review, we extracted 1,421 data points from 89 potentially relevant studies and found that: 1) there is high variability and no clear trends in reported disinfection efficacy of outbreak-relevant pathogens and surrogates; 2) this high variability likely reflects inconsistent and highly variable testing procedures; 3) the majority of included studies evaluated chlorine-based disinfection of stainless steel surfaces, which have limited relevance to low-resource outbreak settings, and pathogens with potential to produce outbreaks in low-income contexts remain underresearched; 4) improvements in consistency, reproducibility, and reporting are necessary in surface disinfection efficacy studies; and, 5) the selected qualitative approach to synthesize surface disinfection efficacy data from pathogen and surrogate testing nevertheless informs recommendations for disinfection in outbreak settings.DiscussionWe identified 20 studies using pathogens particularly relevant to low-resource settings in surface disinfection efficacy testing: M. tuberculosis (1), V. cholerae (1),
