neurologic manifestations occurring early in the illness.12349DISCUSSIONAlthough the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory sensory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients depends on the variation among study samples,12349 a large telephone-based study demonstrated that these symptoms were 15.1% of total patients and higher in female and young age under 50.9 Interestingly, anosmia and ageusia are not accompanied by nasal or oral symptoms, which developed acutely within four days of dyspnea or febrile complaints,49 and these neurologic dysfunctions are mostly temporary, showing recovery period

challenges of viral safetyIn any case, as Turoctocog alfa is never exposed to plasma, the risk of transmitting known and emerging blood\u2010borne pathogens is virtually eliminated.Purification as method of infectious safetyThe advanced techniques of purification utilized for the production of Turoctocog alfa result in a final product formulation which is devoid of both albumin and animal/human\u2010derived materials.Purification as method of infectious safetyA total of five steps are employed to remove host cells, medium components, chemicals used during purification, DNA, and
