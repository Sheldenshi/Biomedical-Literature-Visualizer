patients suggest the presence of a mild-to-severe cytokine storm in patients requiring admission, which has also been argued as an important cause of death.5,21 Cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a form of systemic inflammatory response usually triggered by a variety of factors such as infections and drugs.22 CRS occurs when large numbers of leucocytes are activated and release pro-inflammatory cytokines, which recruits and activates more leucocytes in a positive feedback loop of hyperinflammation.23 Recently, a key role for macrophages in driving CRS was revealed by analysing CRS produced following chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR T) therapy.24,25 These studies identified human monocytes as the major source of IL-1, IL-6 and nitric oxide \u2013 the main
