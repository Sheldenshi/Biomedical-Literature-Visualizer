phosphorylated SARS-N protein would be a more useful antigen for detecting SARS-N antibodies in the sera of SARS patient than the nonphosphorylated proteins expressed in a prokaryotic system.DiscussionIn conclusion, we can successfully express phosphorylated rSARS-N protein in the baculovirus-insect cell system, and this protein could be obtained at a maximum of up to 1 mg per 1 \u00d7 107cells, which is similar to the previously reported finding for rSARS-N protein (Ren et al., 2004).", [["sera", "ANATOMY", 131, 135], ["cell", "ANATOMY", 332, 336], ["SARS", "DISEASE", 139,
