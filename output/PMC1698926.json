cannot drive decision-making.Summary\u2022 The development of an ethical framework for hospital pandemic planning calls for expertise in clinical, organisational and public health ethics.Summary\u2022 Stakeholder engagement is essential for the ethical framework to be relevant and legitimate.Summary\u2022 The ethical framework contains procedural and substantive ethical values to guide decision-making.Summary\u2022 Three key elements of integration of ethics in to pandemic planning are 1) sponsorship from senior hospital administration; 2) vetting by stakeholders and; 3) decision review processes.Summary\u2022 An ethical framework is robust to the extent that pandemic influenza planning decisions are seen to be ethically legitimate by those affected by them.Summary\u2022 In
