(ARDS)) -The majority of cases will remain contained within the lungs -Reactivation can occur when immunosuppression prevents continued proper containment of a latent infection \u2022 Cutaneous lesions almost always result from embolic hematogenous spread in disseminated disease -Approximately 10% of cryptococcal infections will become disseminated, typically occurring in immunocompromised patients (HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, organ transplant, chronic steroid use); dissemination rates may reach up to 50% in AIDS patients, often occurring when CD4 counts are below 50-100/\u03bcL -In patients with disseminated disease, hematogenous spread leads to CNS (70-90%) and skin (10-15%) involvement most commonly \u2022 Primary cutaneous cryptococcosis is very rare following direct

most common clinical presentation of disseminated disease; most mycotic meningitis cases are secondary to cryptococcosis -Patients commonly experience fever, headache, and meningeal signs -Fatal if untreated; so a high index of suspicion is necessary \u2022 Symptomatology is based on the distribution of disseminated disease and can include lymph nodes, skin, eye, kidney, bones, etc.Clinical
