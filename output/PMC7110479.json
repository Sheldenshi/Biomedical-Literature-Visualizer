long-term care/skilled nursing facility; and comorbid medical conditions including coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease, moderate/severe asthma, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease with dialysis, and other immunocompromising conditions (not specifically defined).4 Studies have shown most deaths from COVID-19 to be related to acute respiratory distress and other organ failure.5 However, the association of patient risk factors on in-hospital mortality and health care utilization for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is uncertain.INTRODUCTIONSeveral studies
