succeed but the others failed while the remaining nor succeed neither failed because it depends on software program for different reasons and still need to go under vaccine protocols processing, in those studies that consist with S1 protein subunit especially RBD (the most mutable region that containing mutation sites which define antibody escape variants) was considered the basis for several MERS-CoV vaccine candidates in many studies such as using RBD with aluminum salt or oil-inwater adjuvants; can elicited neutralizing antibodies of high potency across multiple viral strains by Modjarrad [4] and Wang et al. [6] said that the full-length S DNA and a truncated S1 subunit glycoprotein can elicit a higher titer of neutralizing antibodies; this kind of immunization protected non-human primates (NHPs) from severe lung disease after intratracheal challenge with MERS-CoV injection; in another study that was done in Iran by Poorinmohammad et al.

[19] by using the Immune Epitope Database, that said: the nucleocapsid (N) protein of MERS-CoV might be a better protective immunogen with high conservancy and potential eliciting both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses when compared with spike (S) protein; in addition 71 peptides were identified as helper T-cell epitopes, 34 peptides were identified as CTL epitopes; just top 10 helper

showed ILDYFSYPL was similar according my study, Badwai et al [16] and Poorinmohammad and Mohabatkar [15] studies; partially similarity with Iranian study [15] in LLSGTPPQV, ILATVPHNL, LQMGFGITV, and FSNPTCLIL epitopes were noticed except NLTTITKPL epitope that was absent from my study in S and modified S sequence; FSNPTCLIL represents the only epitope that is found in my study in S and modified S sequence; FSFGVTQEY have a high affinity to bind to many alleles and these findings agree with Badawi et al. [16] in addition to ITYQGLFPY in my study through S glycoprotein sequence, but still there are differences in the numbers of selected epitopes that reacted with MHC-I which were higher than that in Badawi et al. [16] , while in E protein FIFTVVCAI epitope has a higher allele affinity followed by ITLLVCMAF, IVNFFIFTV, and LVQPALYLY reverse modified E protein; LVQPALSLY epitope has shown high affinity and then followed by LYMTGRSVY, WFIPNFFDF, YMTGRSVYV, ITLLVCTAF, FVQERIGWF, FLTATHLCV, and CMTGFNTLL, the last epitope which is common between E and modified E protein sequences.DiscussionsPrediction of T-helper cell epitopes and their interactions with MHC Class II showed FNLTLLEPVSISTGS epitope that was considered as the most suitable epitope with a high affinity to 26 alleles in Badawi et al. [16] ; this epitope was actually found in S and modified S sequence of my study, but the difference is that it cannot considered that the most suitable epitope with a high binding affinity to different alleles like in in Badawi et al, [16] study.DiscussionsThere is no research results related to E protein and modified E and S glycoprotein epitope vaccine instead of partial similarity that I found between S and modified S glycoprotein.DiscussionsNo previous study illustrates S glycoprotein and E protein allergic reactions except the study that were done by Shi J et al.

sequence vaccine especially when the selected viruses parts nor longer neither smaller in their length.ConclusionsIn B-cell prediction; mutations can lead to increased numbers of selected epitopes with very few sequence changes noticed, in addition to a large number of shared epitopes between reference and modified sequence; this means mutated sequence has the ability to elicit the same immune response (IR) (response to virus by the same antibodies as in first infections).ConclusionsMutations of the virus sequence can change the frequency of allele and peptide numbers eithers through increased or decreased these numbers, beside presences or absences of some new/old alleles or peptides; same alleles had a different peptide sequences and vice versa.ConclusionsFor MHC-II there were not changed in E & modified E protein alleles & their frequencies & also in peptide sequences & their frequencies were noticed, these may be due to short E protein sequence, while for S & modified S glycoprotein there are minor difference in some peptide frequency numbers either by adding/ lowering one or two numbers just & same for alleles.ConclusionsThere is an allele similarity between E, S, and modified E and S proteins in MHC-II, besides presence of a tiny difference in S and modified S peptide sequences in MHC-II due to the modification that I was introduced before in S reference sequence.ConclusionsThe absence of very few numbers of peptide sequences from S reference sequence in modified S sequence leads to the presence of a new peptide sequences.ConclusionsIn MHC-I a lot of selected peptide sequences that are represented in S glycoprotein reference sequence are missing from the modified one reverse E protein reference sequence due to presence of additional epitopes in E protein modified sequence.ConclusionsThe presence of arginine in some selected peptide sequence vaccine makes it ineffective, so we need to solve this problem either by replacing it with other amino acid from the same group or by finding another ways that make those epitopes visible for immune system (IS).ConclusionsThe presence of mutated sequence can effect on the coverage population in MHC-II
