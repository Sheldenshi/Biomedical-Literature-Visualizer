{"PMC7433917": [["IntroductionWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) has become a crucial technique for investigation of the outbreaks and genomic evolution of pathogens.1\u20133 Technological advances have enabled large-scale studies that involve the surveillance of hundreds to thousands of isolated microbes.2,4\u20136 In addition, high-resolution variant analyses have been used to distinguish isolates whose genomes differ only by a few bases.1,7\u201310 The resulting phylogenomic information is, therefore, expected to help trace the infection route of pathogens.IntroductionShort-read sequencing is a fundamental technology for large-scale WGS analyses owing to its advantages of low error rates (<1%), high throughput, and low cost per isolate.11 Technically, some variant-calling tools, based on read mapping, were reported to output several false results, 12 and de novo assembly was found to be an effective method to improve such analyses for complex genomes.13,14 Even for bacterial genomes, read mapping or reference-guided assembly methods were reported to be influenced by the use of reference genomes15; de novo assembly can reduce biases that stem from the differences of richness of reference genomes among lineages.IntroductionNanopore long-read sequencing is a powerful technology for assembling circular genomes16 and has been applied for the surveillance of outbreaks owing to its portability.17,18 However, the fine-scale (base-level) accuracy of long read-only assemblies could be inferior to that of hybrid assemblers that utilize short reads.11,19Single-molecule real-time
